Notes for research

CODE
	Update scale on image for confidence area
	print more useful info, like as much as i can
	
	So look at doing convolutional masks
	look at test.py
	
	velocity inward is too fast!
	use removal equations!!
	
	removal equations wrong
	consider fraction of (Omega/2*pi) * (current) T_removal

PAPER
	include minimum turning radius initialy
	
	calculate minimum turning radius during reduction transition
	
	
--------- Research Log ----------

10/13/17:
	Updated confidence area to account for diagonal reduction
	It was tricky to get the correct reduction amount, the horizontal and vertical both reduce by different amounts
	
	Time consumption I feel like the new code has more computations, but uses built in libraries so time is about the same...
	
10/17/17:
	Reading about genetic algorithms (GA) evolutionary algorihtms (EA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO)
	Those are mainly used for achieving an optimal solution, so path planning before hand
	
	They are not very good for creating a function
	maybe be able to use machine learning for creating control function of UAV and gimbled camera
	
10/23/17:
	Updated condition on confidence area code. Was fucking up when subtracting UAV at radius > radius_limit. 
	Worked a little on the journal paper. 
	

	
--------- Search Sims --------------
8/16/17: current data accounts for doing two loops at the beginning of simulation
	time is a little slower in comparison


--------- Attack Sims --------------



--------- Confidence Sims ----------
10/23/17:
	basically works like it should. starting with two uavs, ADD, SUB, ADD test. 
	
	
--------- Smart Sims --------------
