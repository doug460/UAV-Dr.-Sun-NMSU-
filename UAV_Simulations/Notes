Notes for research

CODE
	Update scale on image for confidence area
	print more useful info, like as much as i can
	
	So look at doing convolutional masks
	look at test.py
	
	velocity inward is too fast!
	use removal equations!!
	
	removal equations wrong
	consider fraction of (Omega/2*pi) * (current) T_removal

PAPER
	include minimum turning radius initialy
	
	calculate minimum turning radius during reduction transition
