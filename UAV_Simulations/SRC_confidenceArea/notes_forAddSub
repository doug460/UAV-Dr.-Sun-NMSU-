Notes for adding and subtracting UAVs

Basically have variable array for order of add and subtract

------FOR ADDITION------- 

UAV-PSO
	make uavs move circularly
	add uav behind last uav
	
	choose last uav as UAV-R
	jump to slower speed for other uavs
	
	once at correct distribution relative to UAV-R
		jump to normal speed
		
	adjust time in pso for interpolation reasons
	
Params
	recalculate pso path in params
	
UAV-PSO 
	resume pso path
